Welcome to **SMS Bomber ReZNuM**, a Python-based script designed to demonstrate the interaction with various Iranian web service APIs for sending SMS verification codes. This project is intended for **educational purposes** and **penetration testing** (with explicit permission) to explore HTTP requests, multithreading, and API interactions. üö® **Use responsibly and legally!**

## üåü About the Project

**SMS Bomber ReZNuM** is a Python script that automates sending SMS verification codes to a specified phone number by leveraging the APIs of multiple Iranian web services. It showcases advanced Python programming concepts such as:

- **HTTP Requests**: Using the `requests` library to interact with APIs.
- **Multithreading**: Utilizing `threading` for parallel execution.
- **Error Handling**: Robust try-except blocks to manage network issues.
- **Input Validation**: Phone number standardization with regex.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

**This tool is for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Unauthorized use may violate laws and terms of service of targeted services. See the [Disclaimer](#-disclaimer) for details.**

## üéØ Goals

- Educate users on API interactions and HTTP request handling.
- Demonstrate multithreading for performance optimization.
- Provide a framework for authorized security testing of SMS-based systems.

## ‚ú® Features

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Multi-Service Support | Sends SMS via 40+ Iranian services like Snapp, Divar, and Alibaba. |
| Multithreading | Executes requests in parallel for faster performance. |
| Phone Validation | Validates and standardizes phone numbers using regex. |
| Customizable Delay | Allows users to set delays between requests (default: 0.1s). |
| Error Resilience | Handles network errors gracefully with try-except blocks. |
| Dependency Management | Automatically installs required libraries (`requests`, `urllib3`). |
| Console Feedback | Color-coded output for success/failure of SMS requests. |

## üõ† Installation

**Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.6+** installed on your system.
- A compatible OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Internet connection for API requests.

**Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ItsReZNuM/SMS_Bomber.git
   cd SMS_Bomber
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: The script also attempts to install `requests` and `urllib3` automatically if they're missing.

3. **Verify Setup**:

   Ensure Python is installed:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Run the Script**:

   ```
   python Bomber.py
   ```

2. **Enter Phone Number**:

   - Input a phone number in formats like `+989123456789`, `989123456789`, `09123456789`, or `9123456789`.
   - The script validates and standardizes the input.

3. **Set Delay (Optional)**:

   - Specify the delay between requests (in seconds). Press Enter for default (0.1s).

4. **Observe Output**:

   - The script sends SMS requests to supported services and displays results:

     ```python
     (Snapp) Code Was Sent
     (Divar) Code Was Sent
     [-] Error TimeOut
     ```

5. **Stop the Script**:

   - Press `Ctrl+C` to exit (`User Exited` message displayed).

**Example**

```
$ python Bomber.py
```
```python
Termux Script

    [+] Instagram Channel: @reznum 
    [+] Telegram Channel: @ReZNuM

system:
    [+] Platform: Linux
    [+] Node: my-machine
    [+] Release: 5.15.0

[?] Enter Phone Number (+98) - +989123456789
[?] Enter Sleep Time Between Requests [Default=0.1] - 0.2
(Snapp) Code Was Sent
(Gap) Code Was Sent
...
```

## üìã Supported Services

The script interacts with the following Iranian services (as of the latest version):

| **Service** | **API Endpoint** | **Notes** |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| Snapp | `https://app.snapp.taxi/api/api-passenger-oauth/v2/otp` | Taxi service |
| Divar | `https://api.divar.ir/v5/auth/authenticate` | Classified ads |
| Tap30 | `https://tap33.me/api/v2/user` | Ride-hailing |
| Snapfood | `https://snappfood.ir/mobile/v2/user/loginMobileWithNoPass` | Food delivery |
| Alibaba | `https://ws.alibaba.ir/api/v3/account/mobile/otp` | Travel booking |
| Sheypoor | `https://www.sheypoor.com/auth` | Classified ads |
| Torob | `https://api.torob.com/a/phone/send-pin/` | Price comparison |
| SnappMarket | `https://api.snapp.market/mart/v1/user/loginMobileWithNoPass` | Online supermarket |
| Filmnet | `https://api-v2.filmnet.ir/access-token/users/` | Streaming service |
| DrDr | `https://drdr.ir/api/registerEnrollment/sendDisposableCode` | Medical consultation |
| ... | ... | 40+ services supported |

**Note**: API endpoints may change, rendering some services inaccessible. Open an issue if you encounter failures.

## üîç How It Works

**Workflow**

1. **Input Processing**:

   - The `is_phone` function validates and standardizes the phone number using regex.
   - Example: `09123456789` ‚Üí `+989123456789`.

2. **Service Requests**:

   - Each service has a dedicated function (e.g., `snap`, `divar`) that sends an HTTP POST/GET request to the service's API.
   - Headers mimic a legitimate browser request (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Origin`).
   - Data includes the phone number in the required format (JSON or URL-encoded).

3. **Multithreading**:

   - The `Vip` function spawns threads for each service using `threading.Thread`.
   - A user-defined delay (`Time`) is applied between thread launches.

4. **Error Handling**:

   - Network errors (e.g., timeouts) are caught and ignored, ensuring the script continues running.
   - Success is confirmed via API response codes or specific JSON fields.

5. **Looping**:

   - The script runs indefinitely until interrupted, sending SMS in cycles.

**Technical Details**

- **Libraries**: `requests`, `urllib3`, `threading`, `re`, `time`, `os`, `platform`.
- **HTTP Methods**: Primarily POST, some GET requests.
- **SSL Handling**: SSL warnings disabled for compatibility (`urllib3.disable_warnings()`).
- **Console Output**: Uses ANSI color codes for visual feedback.
